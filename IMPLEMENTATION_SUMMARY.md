```

### State Management
- **Zustand** for global state
- **AsyncStorage** for persistence
- Separate stores for:
  - Authentication
  - Tournament data
  - Players and teams
  - Scores
  - Chat messages

### Scoring System
- Accurate Stableford points calculation
- Handicap-adjusted scoring
- Stroke index consideration
- Team handicap formulas for 2-4 player teams

## 🎯 Golf Scoring Logic

### Stableford Points
```
Albatross (-3 or better): 5 points
Eagle (-2): 4 points
Birdie (-1): 3 points
Par (0): 2 points
Bogey (+1): 1 point
Double Bogey or worse: 0 points
```

### Team Handicap (Ambrose)
```
2 players: 35% lowest + 15% highest
3 players: 30% + 15% + 10%
4 players: 25% + 15% + 10% + 5%
```
